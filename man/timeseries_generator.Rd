\usage{
timeseries_generator(
  years,
  doy.samples,
  abund.type,
  activity.type,
  sample.type,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{Years  for which to simulate data}

\item{doy.samples}{Days of year to simulate observation events.}

\item{abund.type}{What type of variation in abundance to model. Currently supported:
exponential growth (\code{"exp"}), log normal variation (\code{"rlnorm"}).}

\item{activity.type}{What type activity curve to model? Currently supports the
Zonneveld model ("Zonneveld"),
a simple gaussian activity curve ("Gauss"), and a bivoltine activity curve based
on two Gaussian curves ("bivoltine").}

\item{sample.type}{Name of sampling distribution. Currently supported: Poisson (\code{"pois"}),
negative binomial (\code{"nb"}), and zero-inflated negative binomial (\code{"zinb"}). "nb" and "zinb"
will require additional parameters.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for the various timeseries generation functions. See details.}
}
\value{
ggplot object

\details{
For all the additional arguments needed for the various component functions,
see \code{?abund_generator}, \code{activity_gen}, and \code{activity_sampler}. Unfortunately it is not
possible to import details from multiple functions.
